File an Issue
-------------
You can report bugs and feature requests to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/issues).

Please don't ask question in the issue tracker, instead use the [forums](forum.terasology.org).

__It's most likely that your bug gets resolved faster if you provide as much information as possible!__

How to Submit a Pull Request
----------------------------
You are welcome to contribute to the project with pull requests. Please follow the simple guidelines below and refer to the [documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/wiki/Documentation). 

1. Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. Create a topic branch for every separate change you make. The branch should have a short but explanatory name, such as "feature/i18n-de".
3. Apply your changes, committing at logical breaks. Make sure your changes are well-tested. 
4. Update the [README](/README.md) and [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for noteworthy changes, but please __do not change__ the version number.
5. Push your branch to your personal account and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
6. Watch for comments or acceptance on your PR. The PR can be updated by just pushing to the same branch.

__Please note:__ if you want to change multiple things that don't depend on each other, make sure you check the master branch back out before making more changes - that way we can take in each change seperately.


For questions please join us in our [forum](forum.terasology.org) or on `#terasology` (irc.freenode.net).
